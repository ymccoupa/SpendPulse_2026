   LANDING SIGNAL CARDS — EDIT COPY HERE
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
   One object per card on the landing page. Everything a card shows, and
   everything its Signal Details drawer shows, comes from here — nothing else
   needs to change to add, remove or reword a card.

     id        stable key; per-card runtime state is stored under it
     title     card heading. Clamped to ONE line with an ellipsis (Figma R46),
               so keep it to ~40 characters
     body      description. Clamped to FOUR lines on the card; the drawer
               always shows it in full
     navi      Navi-recommended text. Omit for cards with no recommendation
     cta       label of the primary footer button
     status    starting state — 'New' | 'Viewed' | 'Completed' | 'Dismissed'
     ago       relative timestamp
     pinned    true to start pinned. Nothing here sets it: a pin is the
               reader's own mark, so every card opens unpinned and in the
               authored order below
     actionTaken  true if the action has already been taken. Replaces the Navi
               box with the `Last Updated by:` line and enables Mark As Completed
     by / at   who last updated the signal and when. The card and drawer show
               them as one `Last Updated by: <by> at <at>` line (see metaLine);
               the All Signals list shows them as two columns. `at` is optional
     triggered when the signal fired — the list's `Signal Triggered On` column
     detail    id of a bespoke drawer in OVERLAYS. When omitted, the generic
               Signal Details drawer is built from the fields below
     impacts   [[heading, detail], …] rows for the drawer's Impacts block
     exposure  { title, text, stats:[[label, value], …] } — the numbers behind
               the impacts, rendered INSIDE the Impacts block
     series    { name, period, values, ticks, yTitle, note } — the index behind
               an index-driven signal, drawn on its drawer as evidence
     action    { title, text } for the drawer's Navi-recommended Actions block
     actions   [{ id, title, text, cta, icon, overlay, pick, doneTitle,
               doneText, doneCta }, …] — for a signal that offers several
               co-equal actions instead of one. Each renders as its own panel,
               and each is taken independently: `state.signals[id].actions[aid]`
               remembers which ones have been. `pick: true` marks Navi's
               recommended one, which leads the block. Authoring `actions`
               replaces `action`; `cta` on the card comes from the picked one
     doneCta   { label, icon, overlay } — a way back into what the action
               produced, shown in the Actions panel once it has been taken
     ctaOverlay  overlay the footer CTA opens instead of taking the action
                 inline (used by the bespoke transfer flow)
     source    { logo, name } — a third-party provider to credit on the card
               footer and the drawer's meta row (see sourceMark)
     action.naviFlow  id in NAVI_FLOWS. The action hands off to the Navi chat
               instead of an overlay: the drawer closes and the flow plays out
     contracts { id, scope, value, renews, notice, orders:[[po, item, value,
               due], …] } for the Review Contracts form
     transfer  { from, fromLoc, to, toLoc } for the Internal Warehouse Transfer
               form, which is shared by every ASN signal — so the warehouses it
               shows have to come from the signal that launched it
     supplierName  the supplier this signal is about, shown on the transfer
               flow's contact card

   The first three cards are the reference set from the Figma file — their copy
   is verbatim and should not be reworded.

   Agent Studio — demo signal 5's recommended action
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Refining the Opportunity Analysis agent is the one action on the rail that
   leaves Spend Pulse, so it gets real pages rather than a drawer: the studio's
   agent library, then the agent in its two states.

     view mode    `Agent / View / Multi Status / Active` (169:25826) — the
                  shipped agent as a record, read-only. Below the breadcrumb:
                  the Draft/Active tab pair with Copy / Deactivate / Edit, then
                  a two-column body — the identity card over its metadata on
                  the left, and on the right Agent Configuration followed by
                  the collapsible Knowledge / Tools / Triggers / Agents blocks.
                  Built-in content cannot be edited in place, so both Copy and
                  Edit go through the Copy dialog

     copied agent `agent-copy` (227:20527) — the draft, and the only state
                  where anything is editable: a blue banner over a vertical
                  stepper, the agent's form, and the same blocks the view mode
                  carries. Save publishes it, which is why it lands on the CFO
                  Dashboard

   The copy is a demo of a real product surface, so the configuration text is
   the agent's actual prompt rather than a description of it — that is what the
   script's "I see the instructions" beat is showing.

/** One action, as the Navi-Recommended panel or as the taken action.
    A signal with a `doneCta` keeps a way back into what it produced (the
    request that was sent, the reassessment that was started) — otherwise the
    only record of it is a sentence.

    `multi` is set when the signal offers several: the panels then need to say
    which one Navi picked and which are alternatives, so the recommended one
    keeps the AI glyph and a Primary button while the others get an outline
    button. An alternative's `icon` is optional: without one it carries no glyph
    at all, in the head or on the button, which is how the two IT Hardware
    alternatives read — the AI glyph then belongs to Navi's pick alone and
    nothing competes with it. With a single action there is nothing to
    distinguish, so it renders exactly as it always has.

    `lead` marks the first action in the block — the panel 210:26882 describes.
    A signal with one action always leads, and a signal with several leads with
